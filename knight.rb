#1. Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
#2. Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in 
#   a tree. Don't allow any moves to go off the board.
#3. Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. 
#   Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.
#4. Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path 
#   between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. 
#   Output what that full path looks like, e.g.:

#$ knight_moves([3,3],[4,3])
#You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:
#[3,3]
#[4,5]
#[2,4]
#[4,3]
